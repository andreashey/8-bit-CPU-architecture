I have created an 8bit CPU architecture mostly for learning purposes.

The code includes an ALU enginen, condition engine, register Module, ROM file with ROM load module.
The CPU uses a FSM (Finite State Machiene) to switch between: FETCH, DECODE, HOLD, EXEC.
There is included a 10Hz clock as an enable signal for test purposes.
